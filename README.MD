#Webpage_Screenshot_Capture_to_Email Google Script

This is the README file for the Webpage_Screenshot_Capture_to_Email Google Script.

The Google Drive Spreadsheet can be found [here][5].

###Purpose of the script
This script will take a picture using [Page 2 Images][4] and store it in your google drive account. Then you can email yourself the picture after it has taken it. I did not create the script but this was script is a copy of a script created by [Fun But Learn][1]. They originally created the script to take a screenshot of a webpage and store that image in your Google Drive account using [Screenshotmachine.com][2]. I modified the script to use [Page 2 Images][4] and email it to yourself after the picture is stored in Google Drive.

###How to make it functional

Taken straight from their post:

* Go to [Screenshotmachine.com][2] and create an account. After sign up you will get an account key, keep it with you. This account key will be used for the API request.
* Now [open this Google Spreadsheet][3], go to File-->make a copy...
* After making a copy you can close the original spreadsheet. Just keep your own spreadsheet open.
* Provide the required parameters as required.
* After providing details simply press the Verify now button to verify whether the API works properly or not.
* If the API works, it will create a folder in your Google Drive and put the screenshot inside it.
* Once you are conform that the API works well, you can press the Start capturing button to automate the process in a regular interval.
* The frequency of capturing you can customize from the in-cell-dropdown.
